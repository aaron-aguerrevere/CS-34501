# MyHeritage CS-34501

Starting with this project, I'm trying to compile ads developed by Platform Operations in github repos to keep a version control as well as an easy-to-share and consult bucket of ads to promote reusability of certain components. 

In this case, all project information can be found [here](https://legacycom.atlassian.net/browse/CS-34501).

For any additional questions on how these get deployed in our adserver or anything else, please reach out to Paul, Aaisha or Aaron.
